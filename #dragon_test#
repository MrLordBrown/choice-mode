Let us begin.

A knight charges up the slope at you.  His horse pounds at the ground, carrying the heavily armored warrior as if he were a child's doll.  The knight sets his lance to attack you.

How do you defend yourself, O mighty dragon?
*choice
  #I take to the air with a quick beat of my wings.
    You leap to the air, deftly avoiding the knight's thrust.  Now that you are in the air, he hardly poses any threat at allâ€”not that he ever posed much of one to you.  You circle back and knock him off his horse with a swipe of your claw.

    *set brutality %-10
    *goto Victory

  #I knock the knight from his horse with a slap of my tail.
    You swing your mighty tail around and knock the knight flying.  While he struggles to stand, you break his horse's back and begin devouring it.

    *set cunning %+10
    *goto Victory
 
  #I rush into his charge and tear him to pieces with my claws.
    The knight's lance shatters against your nigh-impenetrable hide as you slam into him.  You yank him clean off his horse, slamming him to the ground and ripping his plate armor with your vicious claws.  The fight is over before it has begun. 

    *set brutality %+10
    *goto Victory

  #A puff of my fiery breath should be enough for him.
    You let loose an inferno of fire.  The knight's horse is cooked nicely, and your stomach lets out a deafening rumble as the smell of roast destrier reaches your nostrils.  The knight himself staggers to his feet.  His armor managed to keep him alive, but only barely.

Do you finish him off, victorious dragon?

        Your jaws crush him in a single bite.

        That showed him.

        *goto Naming

      #I let him live to warn others of my immense power.
        "Begone, petty human.  To attack me is to meet your doom," you growl.

        The knight stumbles away as quickly as he can, not even daring to pretend that he could still fight you.
        *set infamy %+15
        *goto Naming

      #Eh.  Now that the threat is ended, he is beneath my concern.
        You leisurely eat the knight's horse.  He slinks away as quietly as he can.  (His heavy armor makes a stealthy escape impossible.)  Still, you pay him no mind as he leaves.

        But, O mighty ${name}, I feel I should let you know that this game is full of choices; indeed, it is nothing but multiple choice questions that determine the course of your adventures as a dragon.  If you don't enjoy answering questions, this game may not be for you!

What are you planning on doing with the ${royal}, anyway?

  #It's all about companionship and good conversation.
    Life can be lonely as a dragon, and interesting conversation is at a premium.  The elite upbringing of royalty makes them more suitable for entertaining dragons.

    But what do you do after you tire of ${royal_his} conversation?

      #Then it's time for a royal feastâ€”by which I mean I eat ${royal_him}.
        The ${royal}'s efforts to entertain you with ${royal_his} stories, harp-playing, and singing become more desperate as your boredom becomes more apparent.  But even ${royal_his} best efforts are not enough, and you devour ${royal_him} without remorse.

One evening, as you pretend to sleep, ${royal_she} makes a break for it.  You are well aware of ${royal_his} departure and could catch ${royal_him} easily, but you let ${royal_him} go.  $!{Royal_She} made several months more interesting, and that's

This would be a good time to talk a little more about your personality.

All dragons can be described in terms of a handful of characteristics, each in opposed pairs:  Brutality and Finesse, Cunning and Honor, Disdain and Vigilance.

Now we're going to view some flashbacks to your days as a wyrmling.

As a young hatchling, you lived with your mother in a cave high up on a mountain.  Your mother had a vast hoard of treasure and a varied hunting range. Some of your siblings chose to spend much of their time reading the rare codices and scrolls your mother had collected.  Other siblings spent their time hunting dangerous game and brawling with each other.  Which pursuit did you prefer?

  #Reading.
    A wise choice that made you more Cunning and taught you Finesse.

    *set brutality %-20

  #Hunting.
    You developed your muscles as you gloried in combat and the kill at
    the end of the hunt.  Your brawls with your siblings also taught you the
    basics of Honor. 

    Brutality and Honor increase.

*label SecondChoice
*comment Second choice trades off cunning vs. disdain

As you reached maturity, you began to threaten your mother's dominance over her territory.  Before you could possibly have bested her in a direct confrontation, she threw you out of her lair and drove you from the lands in which you grew up, leaving you to fend for yourself without any resources beyond your claws, wings, and teeth. 

Did you seek revenge on her by turning some of the humans in her lands against her, or did you consider petty revenge beneath you?

*choice
  #I sought revenge.
    You were unable to truly threaten her, but you forced your mother to
    spend her time suppressing the revolts of human villages.  The dead    
    villagers also provided her with no tribute, reducing the increase of her
    hoard.  Perhaps something more direct would be better as revenge. Still, a real
    gain nonetheless. 

    Cunning and Vigilance increase.
    *set cunning %+20
    *set disdain %-20
    *goto ThirdChoice
  #Revenge is beneath my dignity.
    Disdain for petty matters is essential for a dragon, as it avoids the
    pointless feuds that weaken you and allow your enemies to achieve great
    goals. 
   
    Manipulating peasants is also not the most honorable of activities for a    
    mighty dragon such as yourself. 
   
    Your wise choice increases Disdain and Honor.

After several days of flight, you came across a tiny halfling travelling through the desert.  Even from afar, your keen eyes detected the glint of gold and the sparkle of magic.  This halfling has some sort of magic golden shield strapped to his tiny back.

You knew immediately that this treasure must be yours.

The halfling was far from civilization and would almost surely die soon of thirst and starvation.  For the moment, he seemed to be protected by the power of the shield.

Did you kill him on the spot, ignoring his magical protections, or did you hover nearby and wait for the halfling to die, knowing that you might lose the treasure?

*choice
  #I waited for him to die.
    There's no reason you have to do all the dirty work yourself.  A few hours later, the halfling stumbled, crawled for a while, and finally stopped.  You easily plucked the treasure off of his body, saving yourself quite a bit of work.
